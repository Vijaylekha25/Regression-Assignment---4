    " Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that incorporates L1 regularization into the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. Unlike ordinary least squares regression, which seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals, Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the loss function that penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients. This penalty encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates, effectively setting some coefficients exactly to zero, leading to feature selection."

Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant. However, in Lasso Regression, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding features have been excluded from the model."

    "In Lasso Regression, the tuning parameter is often denoted as lambda (Î»). The value of lambda controls the strength of the regularization penalty. A larger value of lambda results in more aggressive shrinkage of coefficients, leading to sparser models with more coefficients set to zero. Conversely, a smaller value of lambda results in less aggressive shrinkage, allowing more coefficients to remain non-zero. The choice of lambda is typically determined using techniques such as cross-validation or grid search."
